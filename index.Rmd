### Midpoint Deliverable Report

Our domain of interest is about education, more specifically how level and field
of education, and gender affect salary. Our data set was imported from 
**fivethirtyeight** which based its data from the United States Census. The [data set](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)
contains information pertaining to the salary, employment, and gender data 
of different majors and levels of education.
