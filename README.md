## Domain of Interest
**Why are we interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in learning more about how education, field of education, and level of education affects salary. Our group is interested in this area because we believe that education matters and transforms lives. Because of the potential that education can bring to individuals, we hope that current and prospective students can make wise choices in choosing a career and education path. We aim to explore the different factors in education and analyze the correlation in how the different observations affect each other.


**What other examples of data driven projects related to this domain?**

1. [Exploration of college salaries by major](https://www.kaggle.com/cdelany7/exploration-of-college-salaries-by-major)

    This project aims to analyze the starting salaries of different majors in different universities in different regions. They discover that the major with the highest starting salary is physician Assistant.
2. [Payscale School Salary Search](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/School)

    With the available data, this project calculates the ROI for students, highest earning jobs out of graduating students, as well as school statistics.
3. [Visualizing Earnings of College Majors](https://mumid.github.io/VisualizingEarningsCollegeMajors/)

    This very well done project seeks to use data to investigate if students in popular majors make more money, which majors are predominantly male and which majors have most students.
4. [The Economic Guide to Picking a College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/)

    This project shows which majors are worth the resources. It gives a breakdown of how much people with different majors earn. It encourages students to pursue majors that make economic sense.

**What data-driven questions do we hope to answer about this domain and how?**
1. What is the salary difference between STEM and NON-STEM majors in short term and long term?
    - We can compare the salary trends of STEM and NON-STEM undergraduates within short and long term time spans. We can look at which fresh graduates have a higher or lower salary, how their salaries progress through their careers, and how their salaries grow or decrease in the long term.

2. How does the salary differ among different genders (male and female)?
    - We can compare the salaries between working males and females with the same job titles, in the same locations, and with the same age range. We can see which gender has a lower, higher, or the same salary as their opposite counterpart.

3. Do students with a master degree earn more than a bachelor degree in the short term and long term?
    - We can compare the overall salary trends of master and bachelor degree graduates from different fields of study within short and long term time spans. We can look at which fresh graduates have a higher or lower salary, how their salaries progress through their careers, and how their salaries grow or decrease in the long term.


## Finding Data
**Data sources and description of how the data was collected or generated**
1. [538 College Majors Dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors)

All data obtained from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata series, from the United States Census. The data contains
grad students (ages 25+) as well as recent grads (ages <28) with information about basic earnings and labor force information.

**Number of observations (rows) and features (columns) in our data**

1. [all-ages.csv](https://github.com/info-201a-au20/final-project-iwangy/blob/master/data/all-ages.csv) has 174 rows and 11 columns.
2. [grad-students.csv](https://github.com/info-201a-au20/final-project-iwangy/blob/master/data/grad-students.csv) has 174 rows and 22 columns.
3. [recent-grads.csv](https://github.com/info-201a-au20/final-project-iwangy/blob/master/data/recent-grads.csv) has rows 174 and 18 columns.
4. [women-stem.csv](https://github.com/info-201a-au20/final-project-iwangy/blob/master/data/women-stem.csv) has 78 rows and 9 columns.
5. [majors-list.csv](https://github.com/info-201a-au20/final-project-iwangy/blob/master/data/majors-list.csv) has 175 rows and 3 columns.

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

* What is the salary difference between STEM and NON-STEM majors in short term and long term?
* What is the difference in salary when comparing, state, ivy league, party, and liberal arts schools?
* What STEM major has the highest average salary?
